Please ensure you have legal permission to run any of these files. These were all tested in Kali Linux, a Debian distribution.

In order to run these, you will need to ensure Python is installed. You may need to be running as Admin/Root (For Windows/Linux).

In Python, you will need to install nmap if it's not already installed.  For Debian based, the command is 
sudo apt install nmap

For Mac OS, it is
brew install nmap

If using a different distribution, you will have to Google how to do this, or feel free to reach out.
